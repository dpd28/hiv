_Disclaimer: The data in this project was initially created for an introduction to data visualization course at the University of Miami. The data is sourced from the CDC, Kaiser Health and (TK). I am not an epidemiologist and did not have access to consult one about HIV. I did my best in consultation with my professor to analyze and parse the data accurately. Still, **please do not use the data used in this project for public health projects. Using the links provided to my sources can help you get started to do your own analysis which may provide results different from mine.**_
