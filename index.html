                <h1>The Changing Landscape of HIV</h1>
                <p class="drop">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is no
                    longer the death sentence it was 20 years
                    ago. Yet for over 1 million people currently
                    living with HIV in the U.S. and the 40,000 new
                    cases each year, HIV/AIDS remains an epidemic.
                    <strong>The hardest hit region</strong>: The South. Home to a
                    third of Americans the South constitutes more
                    than 52% of new HIV infections. Today, poor
                    people of color in rural areas without healthcare
                    access or health insurance are the most
                    vulnerable. The complex mix of stigma, bigotry,
                    policy, and more cause experts to question if HIV
                    for these communities will ever be resolved.</p>

                <h2>The Deep South is the Hardest Hit</h2>
                <p>More than half of new HIV diagnoses in 2017 are in the Southern U.S. Its scattered geography makes
                    prevention and treatment difficult.</p>

            <h2>HIV Diagnosis is Rising for Young People of color</h2>
            <p>Historically, new HIV diagnosis rates seem to have plateaued. In 2017, rates for men remain stable (23.1)
                and
                rates for women have decreased (5.2) but for Black and Hispanic millennials, rates have increased.</p>

            <h2>The Most Afflicted: Hispanic and African American Gay, Bisexual Males</h2>
            <p>Medical and scientific developments in the past decade along with the passage of the ACA have contributed
                to the declining spread of HIV in some populations; however, HIV still disproportionally aects gay
                bisexual men of color.</p>

            <h2>President Trump's Plan to Eradicate HIV by 2030: Two Policies contradict Goals</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p> President Trumpâ€™s 2019 State of the Union address included a plan to eradicate HIV in ten years. The
                Department
                of Health and Human Services (HHS) has rolled out a plan that targets counties and states, including the
                District of Columbia and Puerto Rico where HIV incidences are high. Yet, in addition to the daily
                challenges
                facing HIV individuals, there are two significant and partisan barriers: </p>
            <p<strong>Dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA)</strong>: Recently, President Trump renewed desire to
                dismantle the ACA,
                the
                law
                that would continue to provide thousands of low-income HIV individuals access to healthcare.</p>
                <p><strong>Medicaid Expansion<strong>: Shown below, states hit hard by HIV are primarily the same states
                            that declined to
                            expand
                            Medicaid. Medicaid is the largest payer of HIV care. Expansion would close the gap and cover
                            thousands.
