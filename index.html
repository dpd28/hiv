                <p class="drop">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is no
                    longer the death sentence it was 20 years
                    ago. Yet for over 1 million people currently
                    living with HIV in the U.S. and the 40,000 new
                    cases each year, HIV/AIDS remains an epidemic.
                    <strong>The hardest hit region: The South</strong>. Home to a
                    third of Americans the South constitutes more
                    than 52% of new HIV infections. Today, poor
                    people of color in rural areas without healthcare
                    access or health insurance are the most
                    vulnerable. The complex mix of stigma, bigotry,
                    policy, and more cause experts to question if HIV
                    for these communities will ever be resolved.</p>

                <p>Historically, new HIV diagnosis rates seem to have plateaued. In 2017, rates for men remain stable

                    and
                    rates for women have decreased (5.2) but for Black and Hispanic millennials, rates have increased.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p> <strong>President Trumpâ€™s 2019 State of the Union address included a plan to eradicate HIV in ten
                        years.</strong> The
                    Department
                    of Health and Human Services (HHS) has rolled out a plan that targets counties and states, including
                    the
                    District of Columbia and Puerto Rico where HIV incidences are high. Yet, in addition to the daily
                    challenges
                    facing HIV individuals, there are two significant and partisan barriers: </p>
                <p><strong>Dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA)</strong>: Recently, President Trump renewed desire to
                    dismantle the ACA,
                    the
                    law
                    that would continue to provide thousands of low-income HIV individuals access to healthcare.</p>
                <p><strong>Medicaid Expansion</strong>: Shown below, states hit hard by HIV are primarily the same
                    states
                    that declined to
                    expand
                    Medicaid. Medicaid is the largest payer of HIV care. Expansion would close the gap and
                    cover
                    thousands.

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>All data was mined and filtered using relatively clean datasets from the sources below with Excel.
                    Percentages were calculated with data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the CDC.
                </p>
                <p>Exploration of charts: Completed with online tools such as Flourish, Data-Illustrator and RawGraphs.
                    Visual design was done first using Illstrator then implemented online using D3.js.
